		<h2 style="color:saddlebrown">Food (Savory & Sweets):</h2>
			<h3 title="Ichiran at Shibuya, Japan" style="color:saddlebrown">Ichiran Ramen</h3>
			<img src="images/ichiranramen.jpg" alt="Ichiran Ramen">
			<p style="color:saddlebrown"><b>Ichiran Ramen</b> is my favorite ramen shop to go to when visiting Japan. What I love the most about Ichiran Ramen is that you get to customize your ramen. You can decide how firm or soft you would like the noodles to be, how spicy, how much garlic you would like to be added, and much more! This picture was taken on the last night of being in Japan.</p>
	
			<h3 title="Dipper Dan at Tokyo, Japan" style="color:saddlebrown">Chocolate Banana Strawberry Crepe</h3>
			<img src="images/crepe.jpg" alt="Chocoalte Strawberry Banana Crepe">
			<p style="color:saddlebrown"><b>Chocolate Banana Straberry Crepe</b> is my favorite, and when I mean favorite, I <em>loooove</em> it! It's sweet, but not overly sweet and has the perfect amount of straberries, banana, whipcream, and chocoalte syrup. This picture was taken on the last night of being in Japan, and of course I had to stop by and buy me some yummy crepes!</p> 
	
		<h2 style="color:saddlebrown">Places:</h2>
			<h3 title="Aeon movie theater at Yao, Japan" style="color:saddlebrown">Movie Theater</h3>
			<img src="images/kaguyasamamovie.jpg" alt="Kaguya-sama Love is War Movie Poster">
			<p style="color:saddlebrown">Going to the movie theather to watch "<b><i>Kaguya-sama Love is War</i></b>", has a special place in my heart because that is the first movie I ever went to go watch on my own. My favorite actor and actress were the main roles (as seen on the poster) so I knew I had to go watch it. I really enjoyed going to the movies by myself and would like to do it again soon. </p>
	
			<h3 title="Shigaraki, Japan" style="color:saddlebrown">Pottery Making</h3>
			<img src="images/potterymaking.jpg" alt="Pottery Making">
			<p style="color:saddlebrown">My cousin's family invited me to go make pottery with them, and this is a picture of me making a cup using a wheel. I have never made pottery using a wheel before, so even making a simple cup without a handle was very difficult!<br><br><b title="Pottery cup I made">Below is my finished cup!</b></p>
			<img src="images/cup.jpg" alt="Cup Made From Pottery Wheel">
			<p style="color:saddlebrown">The shape of the cup itself is not perfect, but that is what makes it unique and one of a kind. I love this cup and I use it everyday to drink hot tea.</p>
